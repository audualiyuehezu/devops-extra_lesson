# This task is about how to debug and the first way is to look in code 
#if not found check error in terminal
# To trace your step back you can use in terminal "bash -x ./filename" this help you trace your shell script line by line (step by step)

# another method for debugging is "set -x" from the line you want to start from in the script and use "set +x" to point where you want to stop specificing in the script.
